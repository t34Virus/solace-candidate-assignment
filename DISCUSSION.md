# Discussion: Improvements and Reflections

First off, this project was a lot of fun! Working on this felt like a great challenge, and I enjoyed digging into the functionality and thinking through the user experience. That said, thereâ€™s always room for improvement, and here are a few things I wouldâ€™ve liked to refine or add:

## 1. Tests for Load Times
While I did focus on optimizing the data fetching and handling large datasets like 1.5 million advocates, I didnâ€™t have the chance to write actual performance tests for load times. It would have been great to benchmark the application under different conditions to ensure that everything remains smooth and snappy regardless of the dataset size or user interactions.

## 2. Advanced Filtering System
The search functionality works well, but I think users would really benefit from a more robust filtering system. Iâ€™d love to add filters for attributes like:
- **City**
- **Degree**
- **Specialties**
- **Years of Experience**
- **Gender**

This would make it easier for users to narrow down their search results and find exactly what theyâ€™re looking for. It could also pair nicely with a tag-style UI for selected filters to keep everything clean and intuitive.

## 3. Flip Card Animation
I initially had a flip card animation in place, but after testing, I decided to go with a cleaner click/fade-in-out approach for viewing advocate specialties. It felt less distracting and more professional overall. That said, the flip animation was a fun idea, and Iâ€™d consider revisiting it in the future with a more subtle execution or as an optional toggle.

## Final Thoughts
This was a great project to work on, and I loved the opportunity to combine functionality, performance considerations, and creativity into one package. Thereâ€™s always more to improve, but I feel satisfied about the result! ðŸŽ‰
